This app was made while learning some of the nextjs14 concepts and features, with mongodb atlas for a backend to familiarise myself with nosql databases.

Github was added as 3rd party authentication.

If you like to try out the app, please create a .env file as well in the root folder with the variables for
MONGO database connection string, AUTH_SECRET ,AUTH_URL
